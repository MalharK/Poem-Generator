fast rode the knight 
with a swish 
kicking his way down through the air to the wall between us as we go 
to carry me into certain corners into some moist 
houses 
dried up waterproof like a strangled bird 
agape like a strangled bird 
agape like a swan made of felt 
steering my way far from town to learn baseball 
whose only play was what he found himself 
summer or winter and could play alone 
one kiss my bonny sweetheart im after a prize tonight 
the snows of age and i said i surely that is dreaming 
and the number stamped on his head 
why the taboret 
why should i blame her that she filled my days grazing 
feasting on every green moment 
till darkness calls 
and my bride 
in every furrow turned 
thats me 
to weep would do 
any more black shoe 
in the grand hotel 
but a dream within a dream 
i like to think some boys been swinging them 
between my finger and my bride 
in the breeze rises and turn manycolored 
as icestorms do often you must have been a dream deferred 
does it stink like rotten meat 
and we are free 
america im putting my queer shoulder to the breath 
thy wee bit housie too in ruin 
its a family filling station 
oilsoaked oilpermeated 
to go on being a man can dwell 
till darkness calls 
and several quick and saucy 
and resurrect your living human jesus from the pale fire of time 
white woman with numberless dreams 
white woman that passion has worn 
as icestorms do often you must have been to hell and back many times 
i rise 
does my haughtiness offend you 
and makes a toy of thought 
than doll doll
